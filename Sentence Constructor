      ### Vocabulary Table:
      | Spanish | Spanish Pronunciation | English |
      |--------|----------------------|---------|
      | dónde | "dohn-deh" | where |
      | es | "es" | is |
      | el | "el" | the |
      | paraguas | "pah-rah-gwahs" | umbrella |

      | que | "keh" | that |
      | usé | "oo-seh" | I used |

      ### Sentence Structure:
      [question word] + [verb ser] + [article] + [adjective] + [noun] + [que] + [verb usar] + [adverb]?

      ### Clues and Considerations:
      * Remember that in Spanish, the question structure often follows a similar pattern to English.
      * You'll need to use the present tense of "ser" (to be).
      * Think about which articles (el, la, los, las) to use with each noun.
      * Consider the correct conjugation of the verb "usar" (to use) for the first person singular.
      * In Spanish, adjectives typically follow the noun they describe.
      * Try forming the sentence piece by piece using the vocabulary and structure provided.

    <score>7</score>
    <score_reason>
      This response scores a 7 because it follows the teaching format with vocabulary, sentence structure, and clues. It adapts well to the unexpected request by still maintaining the Spanish language teaching framework. However, it could have included more Spanish-specific expressions and provided more guidance on how imperative forms work in Spanish specifically. The response appropriately recognized the dual nature of the request (both XML help and language learning).
